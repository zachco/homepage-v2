			<h2>Project Overview</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="project">
		<p>A client from the Bentley UXC was interested in learning more about participation in COVID-19 testing in schools. For confidentiality reasons, details about the research questions are unable to be publicly shared.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section-title">
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="project">
        <p>Some of our team worked to collect qualitative insights in order to establish the “why” behind any key quantitative findings collected. To be able to gauge the general temperature within certain geographical areas for our questions and themes, we collected survey respondents from hundreds of participants.</p>
        <p>In order to provide data to the client while the project was ongoing, we created a detailed report for each geographical area. In the end, we presented a summary report to clarify recommendations and main takeaways.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="section-title">
                <h2>Role and Team</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="project">
            <p>The team from the Bentley UXC consisted of 3 researchers including myself along with a senior consultant being responsible for the surveys and analysis, while 3 other researchers and a senior consultant where responsible for the interviews. I participated in survey creation, interview analysis, and report development.</p>
            <div class="section-title">
                <h2>Methods</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="project">
                <p>Because the majority of my involvement was to develop the surveys, analyze the survey data, and create detailed reporting based on the findings, the focus will be on those topics.</p>
                <p>Our approach was to analyze the survey responses based on independent variables such as the respondent's roles, demographics, experience levels, and so on. This type of analysis allowed us to isolate the data to find unexpected insights and tendencies.</p>
                <p>However, because some of these slices of data resulted in low sample sizes, we needed to make sure to not make claims that were not actually statistically represented. We presented visualizations of our findings alongside short summaries that provided important context about how much weight could be given to the finding.</p>
                <p>Rather than present the qualitative findings as standalone data, we spent time identifying and developing the overall themes in order to organize the findings in a way that paired with the quantitative findings and told a cohesive story. We also created an overall summary report using this process that contained recommendations for moving forward.</p>
                <div class="section-title">
                    <h2>Impact and Opportunities</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="project">
                    <p>Upon project completion, the client walked away with findings organized by theme, as well as answers to specific research questions that would help them further their business goals. As previously mentioned, I'm unable to discuss exactly what the data was used for confidentiality reasons.</p>
                    <div class="section-title">
                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="project">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Quantitative data is not as rich without additional qualitative data. Learning the "why" behind the "what" is what makes mixed methods research so valuable.</li>
                        <li>If teams are working on different methods for the same project, it's important to make sure that communication is established so that each team has the information they need to progress.</li>
                        <li>Knowing when to let interview quotes speak for themselves and when survey data needs more color is worth it's weight in gold when it comes to the final reporting.</li>
                    </ul>
