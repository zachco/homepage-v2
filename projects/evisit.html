        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
        <p>We conducted an expert review and usability studies for eVisit, a tele-health company that allows patients to virtually connect with different types of medical providers.</p>
        <p>The tasks were created in partnership with eVisit to ensure that the proper success criteria was achieved. Prior to conducting these usability tests, the team performed an expert review and heuristic evaluation of the eVisit platform both individually and as a team.</p>
        <p>Because of eVisit's current key difficulties in areas such as the ability to manage only one schedule at a time, the ability to see all provider's schedules for a region at once, and the ability to change schedules more frequently than monthly or weekly, the study was conducted with these future concepts in mind.</p>

    <div class="section-title">
        <h2>Challenge</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
        <p>The goal of this usability test was to observe how users navigate eVisit's availability interface and to develop targeted design recommendations based off of those findings.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-title">
        <h2>Role and Team</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
        <p>4 researchers from Bentley University, including myself. Our team partnered with eVisit, a tele-health company that allows patients to
            virtually connect with different types of medical providers. From their team, we worked directly with a UX
            designer and researcher. I was responsible for conducting and individual expert review, moderating usability tests, and developing sections of the report.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-title">
        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <img src="/assets/bentley/evisit/eVisit method.png">
        <p>Our team conducted eight one-hour remote user testing sessions in addition to a pilot test. We recruited
            eight people with relevant backgrounds in healthcare or healthcare administration. Participants were asked to complete a screener and sign a consent form prior to the session.
            Each session had a single participant, a moderator, and a note-taker.</p>
        <p>To begin the test, the participant answered a few preliminary questions about their past experience with
            eVisit and similar scheduling interfaces. Next, the moderator guided the participant through four
            predetermined tasks. All tasks centered around eVisit's availability calendar, where providers and
            administrators set up prospective work hours. Two of the tasks focused on setting and managing a provider's
            own availability. The remaining two tasks were from an administrator's perspective, managing calendars for
            multiple providers.</p>
        <p>After completing each task, the moderator asked the participant about their experience, expectations and
            overall impressions of eVisit. At the end of the session, the participant was asked questions about their
            overall experience while using eVisit and possible suggestions for improvements. After completing the study,
            participants were contacted by eVisit to receive compensation for their time.</p>

            <h2>Impact and Opportunities</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <img src="/assets/bentley/evisit/eVisit findings.png">
            <p>The studies revealed that the most common usability issues that participants encountered were difficulty
                finding their availability calendar in order to set their availability, indistinct ways to tell which
                practice the user is currently in, setting their availability for multiple days, and being able to
                select end dates for repeating schedules in the calendar.</p>
            <p>Our team's expert review and usability testing revealed a plethora of opportunities for eVisit regarding
                the scheduling platform for both scheduling an appointment and for modifying a physician's availability
                calendar.</p>
            <p>The top-level recommendations for eVisit based on the most frequently found issues are as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The availability calendar should be as accessible as the scheduling calendar.</li>
                <li>Allow greater flexibility and ease in setting availability, such as setting availability for more
                    than one day at a time, as well as setting an end date to repeating availability, allowing daily
                    views and monthly views in addition to weekly, reducing the need to scroll to see an entire day,
                    etc.</li>
                <li>“Available” and “Schedulable” terminology should be consistent across the platform and consistent
                    with industry terminology standards.</li>
            </ol>
            <img src="/assets/bentley/evisit/eVisit next steps.png">
            <p>Overall, eVisit's scheduling platform does not cause significant data loss; however, it does not offer
                capabilities and features on par with current scheduling platforms in the healthcare industry. We
                believe that our recommendations included in our report, coupled with those in our expert review, would
                greatly improve eVisit's platform by offering increased capabilities and flexibility for both the
                clinical staff and providers.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <ul>
                <li>It's difficult to maintain consistency across a team of researchers, as each has their own style of conducting interviews and reference to the script.</li>
                <li>Heuristic evaluations or expert reviews can be a great way of identifying possible pain points in a product prior to usability testing, which may give more solid data.</li>
                <li>If we had more time, a competitive analysis would have also been a good way to identify areas in the product where other existing software has established patterns in the industry that users may come to expect.</li>
